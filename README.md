# Hello!!!
## Im Brick (Software, Fish, Book, Sakana, SakanaSoftware)

### What is brick:
Im not a real coder, I just write random barely usable stuff for fun and maybe practice. One day that may change, who knows...
Im more focused on python now, but also Im interested in learning C++ and CommonLISP.
Im thinking about creating visual novel, or some game on Godot...


### Random stuff
- fun fact 1: World actually isnt real. It's just an illusion.
